# Frontend Deployment Guide

Your React frontend is now properly configured for production deployment!

## Build Process

The build process has been fixed and optimized:

1. **Fixed build script**: Changed from `vite` to `vite build`
2. **Production configuration**: Added proper build settings with code splitting
3. **Optimized assets**: CSS and JS are properly minified and chunked

## Building for Production

Run these commands in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Or use the deploy script (same as build but with helpful message)
npm run deploy
```

This will create a `dist/` folder with all the production-ready files.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Static Hosting (Recommended)

Deploy the `dist/` folder to any static hosting service:

- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist/` folder or connect your GitHub repo
- **Vercel**: Use their CLI or connect your GitHub repo
- **GitHub Pages**: Use a GitHub Action to deploy the `dist/` folder
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Upload `dist/` contents to S3 bucket
- **Firebase Hosting**: `firebase deploy` after configuring

### 2. Manual Upload

Simply upload all files from the `dist/` folder to your web server.

## Built Files Structure

```
dist/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── vite.svg           # Favicon
└── assets/
    ├── index-*.js     # Main application code (186KB)
    ├── vendor-*.js    # React dependencies (11KB)
    ├── ui-*.js        # UI libraries (4KB)
    └── index-*.css    # Styles (14KB)
```

## API Configuration

The app is currently configured to proxy API calls to:
`https://demo-visualizer.onrender.com`

For production, you may want to:
1. Update the API URL in `vite.config.js`
2. Set up your own backend API
3. Configure environment variables for different environments

## Performance Features

- **Code Splitting**: Vendor libraries are separated from main code
- **Minification**: All JS and CSS are minified
- **Gzip Compression**: Files are compressed for faster loading
- **Cache Busting**: Asset filenames include hashes for proper caching

## Testing the Build

```bash
# Test the built application locally
npm run preview
```

This serves the `dist/` folder on `http://localhost:4173`

## Environment Variables

If you need environment-specific configuration, create `.env` files:
- `.env.local` (development)
- `.env.production` (production)

Example:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.com
```
