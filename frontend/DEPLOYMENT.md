# Frontend Deployment Guide

Your React frontend is now properly configured for production deployment!

## ✅ Latest Fixes Applied

### API Connection Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Vercel deployment was getting HTML instead of JSON from API calls
- **Root Cause**: Proxy configuration only works in development, not production
- **Solution**: Added environment-based API URL configuration
- **Files Updated**: `.env.production`, `UI.jsx` with proper API base URLs

### Build Process Fixed
- **Fixed build script**: Changed from `vite` to `vite build`
- **Production configuration**: Added proper build settings with code splitting
- **Optimized assets**: CSS and JS are properly minified and chunked

## Building for Production

Run these commands in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Or use the deploy script (same as build but with helpful message)
npm run deploy
```

This will create a `dist/` folder with all the production-ready files.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Static Hosting (Recommended)

Deploy the `dist/` folder to any static hosting service:

- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist/` folder or connect your GitHub repo
- **Vercel**: Use their CLI or connect your GitHub repo
- **GitHub Pages**: Use a GitHub Action to deploy the `dist/` folder
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Upload `dist/` contents to S3 bucket
- **Firebase Hosting**: `firebase deploy` after configuring

### 2. Manual Upload

Simply upload all files from the `dist/` folder to your web server.

## Built Files Structure

```
dist/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── vite.svg           # Favicon
└── assets/
    ├── index-*.js     # Main application code (186KB)
    ├── vendor-*.js    # React dependencies (11KB)
    ├── ui-*.js        # UI libraries (4KB)
    └── index-*.css    # Styles (14KB)
```

## API Configuration

The app is currently configured to proxy API calls to:
`https://demo-visualizer.onrender.com`

For production, you may want to:
1. Update the API URL in `vite.config.js`
2. Set up your own backend API
3. Configure environment variables for different environments

## Performance Features

- **Code Splitting**: Vendor libraries are separated from main code
- **Minification**: All JS and CSS are minified
- **Gzip Compression**: Files are compressed for faster loading
- **Cache Busting**: Asset filenames include hashes for proper caching

## Testing the Build

```bash
# Test the built application locally
npm run preview
```

This serves the `dist/` folder on `http://localhost:4173`

## Environment Variables

The application now uses environment variables for API configuration:

### Production Environment
- **File**: `.env.production`
- **Variable**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://demo-visualizer.onrender.com`
- **Purpose**: Tells the frontend where to find the API in production

### How It Works
- **Development**: Uses Vite proxy (configured in `vite.config.js`)
- **Production**: Uses the full API URL from environment variable
- **Fallback**: If no environment variable, defaults to the demo API

### Custom API Setup
If you're deploying your own backend:
1. Update `.env.production` with your API URL
2. Ensure your backend has CORS enabled (like the demo API does)
3. Redeploy the frontend

Example custom setup:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-custom-api.com
```
